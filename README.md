# University Project â€“ Research on Convolutional Graph Neural Networks
This repository contains a research project I conducted for a university exam, focusing on Convolutional Graph Neural Networks (ConvGNNs).

The work explores how neural network architectures can be extended to graph-structured data, analyzing the principles behind graph convolutions with a focus on mathematical theory and applications.

This project provided valuable insight into advanced deep learning techniques and their intersection with network theory.
